## Summary
Total Tables: 7
Total Columns: 56

### Table Types:
- BILLING_EVENTS: TABLE (8 columns)
- FEATURE_USAGE: TABLE (8 columns)
- LICENSES: TABLE (8 columns)
- MEETINGS: TABLE (9 columns)
- PARTICIPANTS: TABLE (8 columns)
- SUPPORT_TICKETS: TABLE (8 columns)
- USERS: TABLE (8 columns)

### Common Patterns:
- All tables include LOAD_TIMESTAMP and UPDATE_TIMESTAMP for audit purposes
- All tables include SOURCE_SYSTEM for data lineage tracking
- Most identifier fields use VARCHAR(16777216) data type
- Date fields use DATE data type
- Timestamp fields use TIMESTAMP_NTZ(9) data type
