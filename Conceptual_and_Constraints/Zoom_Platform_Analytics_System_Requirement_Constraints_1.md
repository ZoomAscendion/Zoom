## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Platform Usage & Adoption Business Rules

   - Weekly Active User (WAU): User who has hosted or attended at least one meeting in a 7-day period
   - Monthly Active User (MAU): User who has hosted or attended at least one meeting in a 30-day period
   - Active user counts must be calculated using distinct user identifiers to avoid double counting

   - Minimum meeting duration for analytics inclusion: 1 minute
   - Maximum reasonable meeting duration: 24 hours (1440 minutes)
   - Meetings with duration > 24 hours require validation and potential data correction
