# Model Data Constraints for Zoom Platform Analytics System

## 1. Data Expectations

### 1.1 Data Completeness
1. All meetings must have complete duration information (Duration_Minutes) for accurate usage analytics
2. User information (User_ID, Plan_Type) must be complete for all platform usage analysis
3. Meeting host information (Host_ID) must be present for all meetings to enable user-meeting relationships
4. Support ticket information must include User_ID, Type, and Resolution_Status for complete analysis
5. Billing events must contain complete Event_Type and Amount information for revenue calculations
6. License information must include License_Type, Start_Date, and Assigned_To_User_ID for utilization analysis

### 1.2 Data Accuracy
1. Meeting duration calculations must accurately reflect actual meeting times for reliable usage metrics
2. Active user counts must be based on users who have hosted at least one meeting
3. Feature adoption rates must accurately represent the proportion of users utilizing specific features
4. Ticket resolution times must be calculated based on actual Open_Date and Close_Date differences
5. Revenue calculations must sum all monetary amounts from billing events accurately
6. License utilization rates must reflect the actual proportion of assigned licenses

### 1.3 Data Format
1. Duration_Minutes must be stored as non-negative integers for consistent calculations
2. Start_Time and End_Time must follow valid timestamp formats for temporal analysis
3. Amount fields in billing events must be stored as positive numbers with appropriate decimal precision
4. Date fields (Open_Date, Start_Date, End_Date) must follow consistent date format standards
5. User identification fields must maintain consistent format across all related tables

### 1.4 Data Consistency
1. Meeting_ID references must be consistent across Meetings, Attendees, and Features_Usage tables
2. User_ID references must be consistent across Users, Meetings, Support_Tickets, Billing_Events, and Licenses tables
3. Plan_Type and License_Type values must be consistent across user and license records
4. Feature_Name values must be standardized across all feature usage records
5. Meeting_Type classifications must be consistent for accurate categorization and analysis

## 2. Constraints

### 2.1 Mandatory Fields
1. User_ID: Required for all user-related records to enable proper relationship mapping
2. Meeting_ID: Required for all meeting-related records to ensure data integrity
3. Duration_Minutes: Required for all meetings to support usage analytics and KPI calculations
4. Start_Time: Required for all meetings to enable temporal analysis and trend identification
5. Host_ID: Required for all meetings to establish user-meeting relationships
6. Event_Type: Required for all billing events to categorize revenue streams
7. Amount: Required for all billing events to enable revenue calculations
8. License_Type: Required for all licenses to support utilization and revenue analysis

### 2.2 Uniqueness Requirements
1. User_ID: Must be unique within the Users table to prevent duplicate user records
2. Meeting_ID: Must be unique within the Meetings table to ensure distinct meeting identification
3. Support ticket identifiers: Must be unique to prevent duplicate ticket tracking
4. License identifiers: Must be unique to ensure proper license management
5. Billing event identifiers: Must be unique to prevent duplicate revenue counting

### 2.3 Data Type Limitations
1. Duration_Minutes: Must be non-negative integer values only
2. Amount: Must be positive numeric values for billing events
3. Usage_Count: Must be non-negative integer values for feature usage tracking
4. Start_Time and End_Time: Must be valid timestamp data types
5. Open_Date and Close_Date: Must be valid date data types
6. Start_Date and End_Date for licenses: Must be valid date data types

### 2.4 Dependencies
1. Meeting records depend on valid User records through Host_ID relationship
2. Attendee records depend on valid Meeting records through Meeting_ID relationship
3. Features_Usage records depend on valid Meeting records through Meeting_ID relationship
4. Support_Tickets depend on valid User records through User_ID relationship
5. Billing_Events depend on valid User records through User_ID relationship
6. Licenses depend on valid User records through Assigned_To_User_ID relationship

### 2.5 Referential Integrity
1. Meetings.Host_ID must reference existing Users.User_ID
2. Attendees.Meeting_ID must reference existing Meetings.Meeting_ID
3. Features_Usage.Meeting_ID must reference existing Meetings.Meeting_ID
4. Support_Tickets.User_ID must reference existing Users.User_ID
5. Billing_Events.User_ID must reference existing Users.User_ID
6. Licenses.Assigned_To_User_ID must reference existing Users.User_ID

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Data Processing Rules
1. Active user count must be calculated as unique users who have hosted at least one meeting
2. Total meeting minutes must be calculated by summing Duration_Minutes across all meetings
3. Average meeting duration must be calculated by averaging Duration_Minutes across all meetings
4. Feature adoption rate must be calculated as proportion of users using specific features compared to total user base
5. Average ticket resolution time must be calculated using the difference between Open_Date and Close_Date
6. License utilization rate must be calculated as proportion of assigned licenses to total available licenses
7. Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) must be calculated by summing recurring billing events per month

### 3.2 Reporting Logic Rules
1. Daily Active Users (DAU) must count unique users who hosted meetings within a 24-hour period
2. Weekly Active Users (WAU) must count unique users who hosted meetings within a 7-day period
3. Monthly Active Users (MAU) must count unique users who hosted meetings within a 30-day period
4. Ticket volume by type must categorize tickets based on predefined Type values
5. Revenue by License_Type must group billing events according to user's license classification
6. First-contact resolution rate must calculate percentage of tickets resolved without escalation
7. Churn rate must measure fraction of users who stopped using the platform compared to total users

### 3.3 Transformation Guidelines
1. Type and Resolution_Status values must be validated against predefined lists during data ingestion
2. License_Type values must be standardized to predefined categories (Basic, Pro, Business, Enterprise)
3. Start_Date must be before End_Date for all license records
4. Meeting duration calculations must handle timezone considerations for accurate reporting
5. User data anonymization must be applied for Email and User_Name fields for non-authorized users
6. Geographic revenue distribution must be based on user company location data
7. Usage correlation with billing events must identify users who upgrade after reaching usage thresholds
