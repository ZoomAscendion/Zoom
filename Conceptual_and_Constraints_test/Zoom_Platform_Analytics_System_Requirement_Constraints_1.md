### 2.2 Referential Integrity Constraints

1. **Foreign Key Relationships**
   - Meetings.Host_ID must exist in Users.User_ID
   - Attendees.Meeting_ID must exist in Meetings.Meeting_ID
   - Features_Usage.Meeting_ID must exist in Meetings.Meeting_ID
   - Support_Tickets.User_ID must exist in Users.User_ID
   - Billing_Events.User_ID must exist in Users.User_ID
   - Licenses.Assigned_To_User_ID must exist in Users.User_ID

2. **Data Relationship Validation**
   - A user cannot be both host and attendee of the same meeting simultaneously
   - License assignment dates must not overlap for the same user and license type
   - Support tickets cannot be resolved before they are opened

### 2.3 Business Logic Constraints

1. **Usage Calculation Constraints**
   - Active user count must be based on users with at least one hosted meeting
   - Feature adoption rate must be calculated as percentage of total user base
   - Average meeting duration must exclude meetings with zero duration

2. **Revenue Calculation Constraints**
   - MRR calculations must only include recurring billing events
   - License utilization rate must be calculated against available licenses only
   - Churn rate calculations must use consistent time periods

3. **Performance Constraints**
   - Query response time for dashboard reports must not exceed 30 seconds
   - Data aggregation for large time periods must be optimized
   - Real-time metrics must be updated within 5 minutes of data changes

## 3. Business Rules

### 3.1 Platform Usage & Adoption Business Rules

1. **User Activity Classification**
   - Daily Active Users (DAU): Users who hosted at least one meeting in a 24-hour period
   - Weekly Active Users (WAU): Users who hosted at least one meeting in a 7-day period
   - Monthly Active Users (MAU): Users who hosted at least one meeting in a 30-day period
   - New users are counted in the period they first register, not when they first host a meeting

2. **Meeting Analysis Rules**
   - Only completed meetings (with End_Time recorded) are included in duration calculations
   - Meetings with duration less than 1 minute are excluded from average duration calculations
   - Feature usage is only counted for meetings that successfully completed

3. **Trend Analysis Rules**
   - Growth trends are calculated using week-over-week and month-over-month comparisons
   - Seasonal adjustments may be applied to usage metrics during holiday periods
   - Feature adoption rate requires minimum 30-day observation period

### 3.2 Service Reliability & Support Business Rules

1. **Ticket Classification Rules**
   - First-contact resolution: Tickets resolved within first support interaction
   - Average resolution time excludes tickets that are reopened
   - Ticket volume per 1,000 active users is calculated using MAU as denominator

2. **Support Efficiency Rules**
   - Resolution time is measured in business hours (Monday-Friday, 9 AM-5 PM)
   - Escalated tickets are tracked separately from standard resolution metrics
   - Customer satisfaction scores are linked to resolution time performance

3. **Issue Correlation Rules**
   - Meeting-related tickets are correlated with meeting failure rates
   - Feature-specific tickets are used to identify problematic features
   - User plan type influences ticket priority and resolution targets

### 3.3 Revenue and License Analysis Business Rules

1. **Revenue Recognition Rules**
   - MRR includes only subscription-based recurring revenue
   - One-time charges and refunds are tracked separately from MRR
   - Revenue is attributed to the month when service is delivered, not when payment is received

2. **License Management Rules**
   - License utilization rate is calculated as assigned licenses / total available licenses
   - Expired licenses are excluded from utilization calculations
   - License upgrades are treated as new license assignments with end-dating of previous licenses

3. **Customer Value Analysis Rules**
   - Churn rate is calculated as users who cancelled / total users at beginning of period
   - Usage correlation with billing events tracks users who upgrade after reaching usage thresholds
   - Revenue per user is calculated using active users (MAU) as denominator

### 3.4 Data Security and Privacy Rules

   - Weekly reports are generated every Monday morning
   - Monthly reports are generated on the first business day of each month

2. **Alert Threshold Rules**
   - License expiration alerts are sent 30, 14, and 7 days before expiration
   - Usage limit alerts are triggered at 80% and 95% of plan limits
   - Service reliability alerts are triggered when ticket volume exceeds 150% of baseline

3. **Dashboard Performance Rules**
   - All dashboards must be mobile-responsive for access on devices with screen width â‰¥ 320px
   - Data refresh intervals are set based on data criticality (real-time, hourly, daily)
   - Caching is implemented for frequently accessed reports to ensure sub-5-second load times
