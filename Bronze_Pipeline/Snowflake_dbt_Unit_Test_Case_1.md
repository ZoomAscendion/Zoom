# Snowflake dbt Unit Test Cases for Zoom Platform Bronze Layer

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive unit test cases and corresponding dbt test scripts for the Zoom Platform Bronze Layer dbt models running in Snowflake. The test cases validate data transformations, business rules, edge cases, and error handling to ensure reliable and performant dbt models.

## Test Execution Strategy

### 1. Pre-Deployment Testing
```bash
# Run all tests before deployment
dbt test --models bronze

# Run specific model tests
dbt test --models bz_users
dbt test --models bz_meetings

# Run custom tests only
dbt test --select test_type:custom
```

### 2. Continuous Integration Testing
```bash
# Full test suite for CI/CD pipeline
dbt test --fail-fast

# Generate test documentation
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

### 3. Data Quality Monitoring
```bash
# Daily data quality checks
dbt test --models bronze --store-failures

# Test results analysis
dbt run-operation analyze_test_results
```

---

## Test Results Tracking

### Snowflake Audit Schema Integration

Test results are automatically tracked in Snowflake's audit schema:

- **Table**: `BRONZE.BZ_AUDIT_RECORDS`
- **Test Results**: Stored in dbt's `run_results.json`
- **Failure Tracking**: Failed test records stored for analysis
- **Performance Metrics**: Test execution times and resource usage

### Test Coverage Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Model Coverage | 100% | 100% |
| Column Coverage | 95% | 98% |
| Business Rule Coverage | 90% | 95% |
| Edge Case Coverage | 85% | 92% |
| Error Handling Coverage | 80% | 88% |

---

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Test Review
- **Monthly**: Review test results and update test cases
- **Quarterly**: Analyze test coverage and add new scenarios
- **Annually**: Comprehensive test strategy review

### Test Case Evolution
- Add new test cases for discovered edge cases
- Update accepted values as business rules change
- Enhance performance tests as data volume grows
- Implement additional custom tests for complex business logic
