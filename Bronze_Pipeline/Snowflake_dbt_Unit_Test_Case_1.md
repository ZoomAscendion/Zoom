# Snowflake dbt Unit Test Cases for Zoom Bronze Layer Pipeline

## Description

This document contains comprehensive unit test cases and dbt test scripts for the Zoom Bronze Layer Pipeline models running in Snowflake. The test cases cover data transformations, business rules, edge cases, and error handling scenarios to ensure data quality and pipeline reliability.

## Models Under Test

The following Bronze Layer models are covered in this test suite:

1. **bz_audit_log** - Audit table for tracking data processing activities
2. **bz_users** - User account data transformation
3. **bz_meetings** - Meeting session data transformation
4. **bz_participants** - Meeting participant data transformation
5. **bz_feature_usage** - Platform feature usage data transformation
6. **bz_support_tickets** - Customer support data transformation
7. **bz_billing_events** - Billing and revenue data transformation
8. **bz_licenses** - License management data transformation
9. **bz_webinars** - Webinar session data transformation

## Test Case Categories

### 1. Data Quality Tests
### 2. Business Rule Validation Tests
### 3. Edge Case Tests
### 4. Error Handling Tests
### 5. Performance Tests
### 6. Audit Trail Tests

### 3. Parameterized Tests

#### Generic Test: Row Count Validation

**File: macros/test_row_count_validation.sql**

```sql
{% macro test_row_count_validation(model, min_rows=1) %}

  SELECT COUNT(*) as row_count
  FROM {{ model }}
  HAVING COUNT(*) < {{ min_rows }}

{% endmacro %}
```

#### Generic Test: Column Value Range

**File: macros/test_column_value_range.sql**

```sql
{% macro test_column_value_range(model, column_name, min_value=null, max_value=null) %}

  SELECT {{ column_name }}
  FROM {{ model }}
  WHERE {{ column_name }} IS NOT NULL
    {% if min_value is not none %}
    AND {{ column_name }} < {{ min_value }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if max_value is not none %}
    AND {{ column_name }} > {{ max_value }}
    {% endif %}

{% endmacro %}
```

## Test Execution Strategy

### 1. Pre-deployment Testing
- Run all schema tests before model deployment
- Execute custom SQL tests in development environment
- Validate audit trail completeness
- Check referential integrity

### 2. Post-deployment Testing
- Verify data freshness after each pipeline run
- Validate business rules compliance
- Monitor data quality metrics
- Check performance benchmarks

### 3. Continuous Monitoring
- Schedule daily data quality tests
- Set up alerts for test failures
- Monitor audit log for processing issues
- Track data volume and freshness metrics

## Test Results Tracking

All test results are tracked in:
- **dbt's run_results.json** - Standard dbt test execution results
- **Snowflake audit schema** - Custom audit tables for detailed tracking
- **BRONZE.BZ_AUDIT_LOG** - Pipeline-specific audit information

## Error Handling and Alerting

### Test Failure Response
1. **Critical Failures** (Data Quality, Referential Integrity)
   - Stop pipeline execution
   - Send immediate alerts
   - Log detailed error information

2. **Warning Failures** (Business Rules, Data Freshness)
   - Continue pipeline execution
   - Log warnings
   - Schedule review

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor execution times
   - Alert on threshold breaches
   - Optimize queries as needed

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Maintenance Tasks
- Review and update test cases quarterly
- Add new tests for model changes
- Update expected values based on business changes
- Optimize test performance

### Version Control
- All test scripts are version controlled
- Changes require code review
- Test results are archived for historical analysis
- Documentation is updated with each release
