Identify trends in new user sign-ups and meeting creation. 

Analyze usage patterns by user plan type (e.g., Free vs. Paid). 

Assess the adoption of new features. 

Data Relationships Used: 

Meetings Users (via Host_ID)

Features_Usage Meetings (via Meeting_ID) 

Data Attributes in the Report: 

User information (User_ID, Plan_Type) 

Meeting information (Meeting_ID, Duration_Minutes, Start_Time) 

Usage details (Feature_Name, Usage_Count) 

Calculated metrics (Total_Meeting_Minutes, Active_Users_Count) 

KPIs and Metrics in the Report: 

Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users (DAU and WAU and MAU) 

Total meeting minutes per day 

Average meeting duration 

Number of meetings created per user 

New user sign-ups over time 

Feature adoption rate 

Calculations in the Report: 

The total number of meeting minutes is determined by adding up the duration (in minutes) of all meetings. 

The average meeting duration is found by averaging the duration across all meetings. 

The active user count is the number of unique users who have hosted at least one meeting. 

The feature adoption rate measures the proportion of users who have used a specific feature at least once, compared to the total user base. 

Data Constraints: 

Duration_Minutes must be a non-negative integer. 

Start_Time and End_Time must be valid timestamps. 

A Meeting_ID in Attendees or Features_Usage must exist in the Meetings table.

Average ticket resolution time. 

Most common ticket types (e.g., audio issues, connectivity problems). 

First-contact resolution rate. 

Tickets opened per 1,000 active users. 

Calculations in the Report 

The ticket volume by type shows how many tickets were created for each type of issue. 

The average resolution time is calculated by determining the average time taken to close a ticket after it was opened. 

The user-to-ticket ratio compares the total number of tickets raised to the number of active users during the same period. 

Data Constraints 

Ticket_Type and Resolution_Status must be from a predefined list of values. 

User_ID must exist in the Users table.
